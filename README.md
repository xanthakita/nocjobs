# nocjobs
Design and eventual code for a website / web app, and mobile app to register and track NOC based jobs across the country (world?)

## NOCJobs website
 

Idea for Minimum Viable Product: A site that shows locations of various telecom NOCs, call centers, and headquarters locations where potential employees can engage the company directly or choose to go through a recruiter. The site would have targeted ads from recruiters. This would not initially include info for CO techs or field techs, since those are not geographically-specific, but can always be added later.

 

## Future Enchancements:

* Allow candidates to create profiles with their expertise through which recruiters can contact them directly, if the recruiter has a membership with the site. There would be enough of an identity filter so that the candidate's current job is not in jeopardy.

* Ratings and salary info similar to Glassdoor.com. Again, these would be posted anonymously on the site.

* Possible expand and add a similar site for other utility NOCs.

 

### Searchable Data needed:

NOC locations (city, state, ZIP), types of expertise at those NOCs (TNOC, VoIP, ERC, etc). We need to be able to serve ads based on the results from these searches. IE if someone searches for TNOC jobs in Greenville, SC they should see ads from recruiters who work with Windstream.

 

## Revenue streams:

* Banner ads from recruiters/telcos

* Eventually add paid memberships for recruiters that gives them access to active jobseeker profiles.
